## Overview

This project showcases my end-to-end data analysis workflow using PostgreSQL on a Netflix dataset. This project serves as a practical example of how SQL can be used to drive business intelligence and solve real-world problems.

## Objective 

* To use SQL to perform a comprehensive data analysis of a simulated Netflix dataset. 
* Demonstrate my ability to translate real-world business questions into technical queries.
* Extract meaningful insights from raw data, and present findings that can inform strategic decisions. 
* To solve 15 key business problems for a streaming service like Netflix using SQL.
