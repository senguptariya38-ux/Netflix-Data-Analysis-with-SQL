## Objective 

The objective of this project is to use SQL to perform a comprehensive data analysis of a simulated Netflix dataset. This will demonstrate my ability to translate real-world business questions into technical queries, extract meaningful insights from raw data, and present findings that can inform strategic decisions. The project aims to answer key questions related to solving 15 key business problems for a streaming service like Netflix using SQL.
